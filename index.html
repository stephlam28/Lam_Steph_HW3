            Wind Archer
        </h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
            Like the rest of the Cygnus Knights, Wind Archers share a bond with a specific elemental spirit, in this case Storm, the Spirit of Wind. Protectors of nature and all living things, Wind Archers can harness the power of wind to send their enemies spiraling. Like Explorer Bowmen, Wind Archers are most useful at long distances, but they also have their own unique abilities to help them control the field of battle.

            Blaze Wizard
        </h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
            Blaze Wizards are powerful magicians of the Cygnus Knights that, like their name implies, can command fire. Blaze Wizards have a deep connection to Ignis, the Spirit of Fire, and can tap into the entity's power to unleash scorching destruction on their foes. Blaze Wizards may have low HP, but they more than make up for it with their awesome fire spells and attacks. When playing as a Blaze Wizard, always be aware of your surroundings... you don't want enemies to get in too close, so incinerate them from afar.

            Night Walker
        </h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
            Night Walkers are Cygnus Knights that serve... well... the night, obviously. These devious tricksters are lucky and dexterous and have mastered the art of the throwing star. They have a communion with Umbra, the Spirit of Darkness, and use the powers of the night to aid them. When Umbra is unable to heed a Night Walker's call, these sneaky rogues can use poison to stop enemies dead in their tracks. Emo? Maybe. But never underestimate a Night Walker. When the sun sets, you'll never see them coming.

            Thunder Breaker
        </h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
            Thunder Breakers are pirates with a love of storms. Why? What kind of madman would sail head-on into a typhoon??!! Well, Thunder Breakers are Cygnus Knights blessed by Lightning, the spirit of- you guessed it -lightning, meaning that choppy waters are their favorite place to be. Also, they live on the floating island of Ereve, so there's that. Thunder Breakers use knuckles as their main weapon and are useful over both short and long distances. They can also literally throw sharks at people. SHARKS, you guys. SHARKS.
